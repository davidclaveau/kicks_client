        NOTE: Over-40s Scrimmage is not taking place in 2021. It will be back next year.
        The BCGECSS started an over-40s co-ed scrimmage in 2019. We had more than 30 committed over-40s from half a dozen teams. Additional players could join a reserve call-up list.
        For more information, please email Hu Wallis, Vice President.
