      <Typography paragraph>
        The BC Government Employees Co-ed Soccer Society (BCGECSS) is a co-ed recreational soccer league for the enjoyment of all government workers.

        To foster the feeling of fun, no standings or scoring records are kept. Instead, after each game, the opposing teams vote for the female and male player who best combine sportsmanship and skill.

        The season usually starts at the end of April and runs until our wind-up in August. Weekly games are on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Kickoff is generally at 6:30 pm (except for some turf games, which start at 8:00 pm).

        At the end of the season a trophy is awarded to the Friendliest Team. Gift certificates are given to the Classiest Players of the League (10 women and 10 men) who won the individual voting.

        If you would like more information about the league, please browse the website, or contact one of the league officers.
