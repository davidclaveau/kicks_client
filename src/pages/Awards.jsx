      <Typography variant="h4">PETER FUGLEM TROPHY (FORMERLY "FRIENDLIEST TEAM" TROPHY)</Typography>

      <Typography paragraph>
        This award focuses on the intended spirit of the league, which is to promote a friendly and relaxed game of recreational soccer. The trophy was created to emphasize the fun and comradery the games should promote.

        This year the BCGECSS re-dedicated the Friendliest Team Trophy in Peter Fuglem's name. The league has lost a great friend in Peter, who was recently killed in a motorcycle accident. The Peter Fuglem Trophy is a permanent memorial recognizing Peter's significant contributions to the league over many years, and the loss resulting from his tragic death.

        Peter played in the league for many years and also managed the Forests team. He was a strong competitor and keenly sportsmanlike — friendly on and off the field. His teams were a reflection of his personality. Peter was always a voice of reason in league affairs, and in 2017 he stepped forward to be part of the interim executive for a year, at a critical time in the league's existence.

        Peter was widely known inside and outside the league for his major professional contribution to forestry in B.C. — as well as to related areas such as emergency management and air quality management during the major fires of recent years. Those fire seasons were one of the few times Peter asked his BCGECSS friends for a little help, with many of his own players away fighting fire.

        Peter will be sorely missed as a player, a manager, a league executive member, and most of all as a fine human being.
